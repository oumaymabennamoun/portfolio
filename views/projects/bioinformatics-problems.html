        I was searching for coding project ideas related to the biology field when I came across the 
        <a href="https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/" class="projlink">Rosalind.info</a> platform. It contains a collection of bioinformatics programming questions, ranging 
        from lower to higher difficulty.
    </p>

    <p>
        I haven't progressed as much in this project of mine yet (so far, 2 easy problems completed) as
        I've had to take pauses for schoolwork and my portfolio project. However, I hope to complete 
        my projects soon. It's a great way to refresh my memory and skills in the programming languages I learn 
        at classes, with interesting problems and biology context.
    </p>

    <p>
        So far, I haven't had the time to complete many questions aside from DNA count and transcription, 
        as I've had to take pauses for exams and my portfolio project, but I'm super interested in introducng 
        myself to bioinformatics with this problem set. I appreciate that it allows me to refresh myself on 
        the languages I learn at school and how it will push my problem-solving abilities once the problems become 
        more complex.
