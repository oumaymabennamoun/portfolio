        My passion for computer science emerged during my Website Creation elective at Dawson College. 
        Although the course only covered static front-end, I realized I was enjoying the process of 
        working on code for hours on end, and how it felt much like solving a puzzle.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since then, I really wanted to learn back-end development as well, and enrolled in Concordia's 
        SOEN 287 (Web Programming) for Summer 2024. This course bridged my knowledge in dynamic web pages, 
        which I soon applied to my portfolio project.
    </p>

    <p>
        In terms of my portfolio design, I had two goals:
        <br><br>
        1. A clean, readable layout.
        <br>
        2. Reflecting my personal style!
        <br><br>

        Therefore, I went for a balance between customized elements — such as animations, the scrollbar,  
        and a cursor corresponding to project statuses — and making sure the website content remained 
        clear to navigate.
    </p>

    <p>
        I implemented a tag-filtering function in my projects page for additional user interactivity, by 
        pairing JavaScript event listeners with CSS display properties. The entire website application runs on a 
        Node.js server, and I've become more familiar with version control through this project.
    </p>

    <p>
        My portfolio is marked as "Complete", but this status only refers to the first version and deployment 
        of the website. There is a lot to learn and I plan to continue updating my portfolio with new 
        projects and ideas!
