    <p>
        I discovered my passion for computer science during my first semester at Dawson College, 
        when I had taken a Website Creation elective. Although the course focused on basic 
        front-end design, I realized that I actually enjoyed working on code for hours on end, 
        and the feeling of solving a puzzle that came with it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since then, not only have I enrolled in a computer science program at university, but I've 
        also always wanted to learn the back-end aspects of website creation. This led me to enroll 
        in SOEN 287 (Web Programming) at Concordia during Summer 2024. The course successfully bridged 
        my knowledge in dynamic web pages, which I very soon applied in my portfolio project.
    </p>

    <p>
        When it comes to my portfolio's design, I had two priorities:
        <br><br>
        1. A clean, readable layout.
        <br>
        2. Reflecting my personal style!
        <br><br>
        I accomplished my goal with a balance of animations, icons, and a customized scrollbar and 
        cursor that corresponds with my project statuses, without making my website too flashy to nagivate 
        or understand!
    </p>

    <p>
        As for functionality, I am particularly happy I implemented some user interactivity with a 
        tag filtering function that would be useful once my projects section grows. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I marked this project as "Complete", but this refers to the first version and deployment of the 
        website! I plan to continue updating my portfolio with new projects and refinements. This project 
        also allowed me to become more familiar with version control practices - but I still have much 
        I look forward to learning in that area!
